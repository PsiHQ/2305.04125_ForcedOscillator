This repository contains the code associated with [arXiv:2305.04125](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.04125) (both the original manuscript codes and the updated ones after peer review). The files are organised as follows:
#### 1. 2305.04125_DS_Approach_.ipynb: Contains code for generating phase trajectories, Lyapunov exponents and Poincar√© maps. 
#### 2. 2305.04125_DifferentialEquations_Approach.ipynb: Contains code for generating system behaviour in real time, perturbative solution, scaling behaviour.
The revised files (the ones with **_Revised** in their names) include the respective codes for the revised manuscript. They include further figures and computations as had been asked for during peer review.
